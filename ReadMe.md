Design patterns are typical solutions to commonl;y occurring problems ins oftware design. They are like pre-make blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in code

Why should we learn patterns?

* Design patterns are toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design.Even if you never encounter the problems,knowing pattern is still usefull because it gives you the perspective to solve the problems using the object-oriented design
* Design patterns gives us the common language to communicate over the problem,modules or workflow like if we use word "singletone" then it give the idia of single instance object overview

Criticism of patterns -

Usuallly the need for patterns aries when people choose a programming language or a technology that lacks the necessary level of abstaction,in this casempattern becoame a kludge that gives the language much-needed super-abilities
Eg-Strategy patten can be implemented with a simple anonymous(lambda) function in most modern programming languages
* Inefficent solutions
    Pattern try to systematize approaches that are already widely used.This unification is viewd by many as dogma(a belief or set of beliefs that are accepted by a group without being questioned or doubted) and they implement patterns
* Unjustified use
    "If all you is a hammer,everything looks like a nail"
    This is the problem that haunts many novices who have just familiarized themselves with patterns.Having learned about patterns,they try to apply them everywhere,even in situations where simpler code would do just fine
    

Classification of pattern
'Intent' of the pattern briefly describes both the problems and the solutions.
'Motivation' further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
'Structure' of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related

All patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose
* Creational patterns provides object ceation machanism that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
    -Singleton
    -Factory Method
    -Abstract Factory
    -Builder
    -Prototype
* Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into latger structures,while keeping theese structures flexible and efficent.
    -Adapter
    -Bridge
    -Composite
    -Decorator
    -Facade
    -Flyweight
    -Proxy
* Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignement of reponsiblities between objects
    -Chain of Resposiblity
    -Command
    -Iterator
    -Mediator
    -Observer
    -State
    -Strategy
    -Template Method
    -Visitor
